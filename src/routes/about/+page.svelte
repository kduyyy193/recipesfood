	<h4>
		The only food API you'll ever need.

	<p>Our knowledge engineers spent years crafting our complex food ontology, which allows us to understand the relationships between ingredients, recipes, nutrition, allergens, and more.

		We understand "nut free" muffins can't contain pecans (even if the recipe doesn't mention "nuts" anywhere!) and we automatically determine that a recipe with Worcestershire sauce isn't vegetarian (we're looking at you, anchovies.)</p>
